# Configuration
A lot of items in this documentation have referenced this very file for configuration.  
Cerbose uses JSON files for its configuration. These allow lots of configurations, including:
- Custom tags (text and colour required)
- Symbols (e.g., brackets, text divisor, `cerbar` characters)
- Space repeat tolerance
- Timestamp format

## Meta
This is a completely optional section of your JSON file that has yet to see any use. However, you can add it incase it gets a use in the future:
```json
// There are comments here. JSON does not support comments. Please pretend that it does.
"meta" {
  "program": "" // What program this configuration was primarily made for.
  "author": ""  // You, obviously.
}
```
