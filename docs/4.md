# Functions
Finally, we move on to the most important part of this documentation; how to actually use Cerbose.  
First, like any other Python library, ensure that Cerbose is actually imported, with:
```python
import cerbose
```
at the top of your file.  
I also reccomend adding:
```python
from cerbose import cprint, mprint
```
and even adding `cerbar` or `cin` to it if you really need those functions a lot. Though, `cprint`/`mprint` are the functions you absolutely do not want to have to type `cerbose.` for.
