## Post Installation
No, don't skip this, this is unique to Cerbose.
Upon installing Cerbose, your directory should look like this:
```plaintext
cerbose-lib
├── .readme/
│   ├── jrisbanner.png
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── test.png
├── docs/
│   └── DOCS.md
├── examples/
│   ├── config.json
│   └── test.py
├── src/
│   └── cerbose.py
├── LICENSE
├── LICENSE-GPL
├── LICENSE-LGPL
├── LICENSE-MIT
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
```
If it doesn't...well, that's not *good*.  
If you don't have the directory (you probably installed via PyPI), that's okay, either run this in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasperredis/cerbose-lib
```
and `cd` into the directory, or simply go to [the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/jasperredis/cerbose-lib) and download really the only thing you need: `examples/test.py`.

Assuming it does, you can probably delete `.readme/` now, you don't need it unless you're actively checking the README (which is on the GitHub repository anyways).  
Now, to make sure Cerbose is working, try running the test script via the terminal command here (ENSURE YOU ARE INSIDE OF THE `cerbose-lib/` DIRECTORY!:
```bash
python examples/test.py
```
And if on Windows that doesn't work, try this in PowerShell:
```powershell
py examples/test.py
```
If that works, you can continue!
