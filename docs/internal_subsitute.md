# INTERNAL_SUBSITUTE
Yes, that is the correct name. That was a typo that ended up annoying to fix across everything because I copy-pasted it everywhere, so now it's the proper way to spell this dict.

Before we get into functions, there is a universal variable across them; internally, this shouldn't need to be used. This is a dictionary containing the names you input for functions requesting a colour to replace the `colorama` colours. Here is a table showing what all of these colours are:

| Subsitute Text | `colorama` Colour | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"black"` | `Fore.BLACK` | Difficult to see. |
| `"red"` | `Fore.RED` | -- |
| `"green"` | `Fore.GREEN` | -- |
| `"yellow"` | `Fore.YELLOW` | -- |
| `"blue"` | `Fore.BLUE` | -- |
| `"magenta"` | `Fore.MAGENTA` | -- |
| `"cyan"` | `Fore.CYAN` | -- |
| `"white"` | `Fore.WHITE` | -- |
| `"lightblack"` | `Fore.LIGHTBLACK_EX` | -- |
| `"lightred"` | `Fore.LIGHTRED_EX` | -- |
| `"lightgreen"` | `Fore.LIGHTGREEN_EX` | -- |
| `"lightyellow"` | `Fore.LIGHTYELLOW_EX` | -- |
| `"lightblue"` | `Fore.LIGHTBLUE_EX` | -- |
| `"lightmagenta"` | `Fore.LIGHTMAGENTA_EX` | -- |
| `"lightcyan"` | `Fore.LIGHTCYAN_EX` | -- |
| `"lightwhite"` | `Fore.LIGHTWHITE_EX` | -- |
| `"normal"` | `Fore.RESET` | Normal terminal text colour; default for normal text. |

That's it. Short document.
